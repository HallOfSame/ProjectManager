# ProjectManager
A project managing / time tracking tool for work.

I liked how parts of some apps do time tracking. None of them worked the way I wanted though. And most required an account and an email and tried to push their premium plan etc etc.

I also wanted to be able to do TODO lists and possible markdown editing.

Basically an app to track time at work the way I want it.
